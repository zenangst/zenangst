I'm a fun-loving and nerdy Swed living in Oslo, Norway. After getting hooked on creating open source components and can't seem to stop.

I've built and open sourced the following things:

- 🌓 [Gray](https://github.com/zenangst/Gray), a macOS application for tailoring your Mojave experience on an app-per-app basis
- 🌀 [Blueprints](https://github.com/zenangst/Blueprints), a collection view framework that helps to create your layout, it also comes with a few very flexible layout out-of-the-box
- ⛽️ [Differific](https://github.com/zenangst/Differific), just like the name implies, it helps to compare collections of hashable objects
- 🚸 [Family](https://github.com/zenangst/Family), container controllers can be great for composition but they can be hard to manage, this is were Family comes in to help
- 🍫 [Syncalicious](https://github.com/zenangst/Syncalicious), on macOS, preferences are everything; they are what separate your mac from the rest, make it stand out, and give it personality. Setting up a new installation of macOS can be fun and liberating, but it can also be a chore. This is where Syncalicious comes in.
- 💉 [Vaccine](https://github.com/zenangst/Vaccine), it does the heavy lifting when responding to run-time code injection

I've recently taken over responsibility for maintaining [InjectionIII](https://itunes.apple.com/no/app/injectioniii/id1380446739?mt=12) which you can find in the Mac App Store. InjectionIII is a menu-based application that enables run-time code injection in Swift and Objective-C.

When I'm not doing open-sourcing, I find myself writing about it on Medium. You can find my medium profile here: [https://medium.com/@zenangst](https://medium.com/@zenangst)
So, if you like what I do... why not [support me](https://github.com/sponsors/zenangst) and see how far we can take this open-source party? :)

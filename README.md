I'm a fun-loving and nerdy Swed living in Oslo, Norway. After getting hooked on creating open source components and can't seem to stop.

I've built and open sourced the following things:

- ‚å®Ô∏è [Keyboard Cowboy](https://github.com/zenangst/KeyboardCowboy), The missing keyboard shortcut utility for macOS
- üåì [Gray](https://github.com/zenangst/Gray), a macOS application for tailoring your Mojave experience on an app-per-app basis
- üç´ [Syncalicious](https://github.com/zenangst/Syncalicious), on macOS, preferences are everything; they are what separate your mac from the rest, make it stand out, and give it personality. Setting up a new installation of macOS can be fun and liberating, but it can also be a chore. This is where Syncalicious comes in.

When I'm not doing open-sourcing, I find myself writing about it on Medium. You can find my medium profile here: [https://medium.com/@zenangst](https://medium.com/@zenangst)
So, if you like what I do... why not [support me](https://github.com/sponsors/zenangst) and see how far we can take this open-source party? :)
